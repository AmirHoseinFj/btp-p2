# BTP405-Project-2


â€¢	Software product:

For (target clientele): Foodies and restaurant operators looking for a simple and effective way to handle bookings and enhance dining experiences.

Who (statement of the need or opportunity): Face difficulties in managing booking availability, arranging reservations, and improving eating experience for customers.

There is a (product category) for the (product name): The cloud-based RaaS (Restaurant as a Service) technology makes restaurant reservation administration easier.

That (main advantage, strong sales pitch): Enables customers to make, amend, and cancel bookings online with ease, and gives restaurant personnel simple tools to manage booking availability, customer data, and real-time notifications.

In contrast to (main competitive alternative): Manual booking procedures or traditional phone-based reservation systems, which frequently result in mistakes, inefficiencies, and dissatisfied customers.

Our product (statement of primary differentiation): It sets itself apart by utilizing Agile methodologies to guarantee ongoing development and alignment with user needs, putting security and privacy first through strong encryption and authentication mechanisms, and adopting a microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility.




Software Architecture: The restaurant reservation system is made up of a number of loosely linked microservices, each of which is in charge of performing certain functions including notification processing, reservation management, and user authentication. This design allows for the independent deployment and scaling of separate services, which improves maintainability and scalability.

Security Layers: To guarantee the preservation of user data and system integrity, security measures are used at several levels of the design. Data encryption, authorization, authentication, and network security are all included in this. In order to comply with data protection rules, access to sensitive information, such as user profiles and reservation details, is restricted based on user responsibilities and permissions.

Scalability: The system uses cloud-based services to provide horizontal scaling, allowing it to manage a high amount of concurrent users and bookings. While load balancers divide incoming traffic among several microservice instances to ensure optimal performance and availability during high usage periods, elasticity compute resources automatically deploy and scale compute instances based on demand.

Interoperability: Working with third-party apps and current restaurant management systems is made easier by the use of defined protocols and data formats. In order to facilitate smooth interaction with other systems and enable the interchange of reservation data, user information, and other system capabilities, RESTful APIs are offered. This encourages cooperation and communication across different restaurant sector players.
